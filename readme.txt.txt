## Machine Learning Project 1

### Requirements
- Numpy
- python3
- matplotlib

### Instructions to Run
- go to code directory and execute the below commands.
- Instruction to run programs for 1:
	- Run the given command "python run_1b.py" to see results for linear regression using diffrent depth.
	- Run the given command "python run_1c.py" to see results for linear regression using diffrent depth and MSE for train and test data.
- Instruction to run programs for 2:
	- Run the given command "python run_2b.py" to see results for locally weighted linear regression.
	- Run the given command "python run_2c.py" to see results for locally weighted linear regression and MSE for train and test data.
	- Run the given command "python run_2d.py" to see results for locally weighted linear regression and MSE for train and test data for training data with 20 elements.
- Instruction to run programs for 3:
	- Run the given command "python run_3a_b_c.py" to see results for all bits of softmax regression.
- For using different data sets keep the data text files in current folder with similar format as the data sets present in this folder.
- All the functional elements are kept in functions.py

### Notes
- All the data here are obtained from the data generation link(https://ranger.uta.edu/âˆ¼huber/cse6363/Proj1/Proj1gen.php
)
- the data files are arranged as per Proj1 assigned numbers.
- all results are present in results folder with assigned numbers.
- all codes are vailable in code folder.
- all data is available in data folder.
